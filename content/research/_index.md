<div class="make_bg bg_research">

My work focuses on the theory and application of **networked dynamical systems** with a special emphasis on **power-system physics**, **machine learning**, and **graph-based modeling**. I study how flows, constraints, and feedback interact across physical, computational, and economic layers of modern energy infrastructures, and how these interactions shape system behavior across different temporal and spatial scales.

## 1. Mathematical and Graph-Theoretic Foundations

I develop mathematical tools that unify the study of complex networks across physical, cyber, and economic domains.  
My work includes:

- Graph and multigraph representations of energy and infrastructure systems  
- Incidence matrices, weighted Laplacians, and reduced forms  
- Linearized flow operators such as power transfer distribution factors and line outage distribution factors  
- Convex analysis, duality, and operator-theoretic formulations  
- Multi-layer graph structures for modeling interactions among physical, informational, and economic layers  

These methods provide a unified framework for understanding stability, controllability, and global behavior in large-scale networks.

## 2. Physical Network Dynamics and Power-Flow Structure

I study how physical laws determine the movement of energy across a network and how disturbances propagate through the grid.  
Areas of focus include:

- Linear and nonlinear power-flow relations  
- Dynamics derived from conservation laws and graph structure  
- Modal analysis of oscillatory behavior and electromechanical interactions  
- Sensitivity of flows to contingencies, switching actions, and topology changes  
- Flow–potential relationships and the geometry underlying system response  

This work builds a systematic understanding of how physical constraints shape real-time grid behavior.

## 3. Optimization, Control, and Multi-Scale Coordination

Modern power grids operate as equilibria of interconnected optimization and control processes.  
I investigate both the mathematical structure and the practical algorithms that govern these systems:

- Network-constrained optimization and relaxations  
- Distributed and decomposition-based coordination  
- Feedback control as dynamic optimization  
- Multi-rate operation across physical, operational, and economic time scales  
- Learning-enabled optimization under changing system conditions  

These ideas connect the mathematics of optimization with real-world grid operations.

## 4. Machine Learning, Phasor Measurement Intelligence, and Data-Driven Methods

I develop machine learning and statistical methods for real-time situational awareness using high-frequency data from phasor measurement units.

### Event Identification and Oscillation Analysis
- End-to-end event detection based on modal structure and machine learning  
- Semi-supervised techniques that reduce reliance on labeled data  
- Localization of forced oscillations using sparse and subspace-based methods  
- Signal processing pipelines for operational intelligence  

### Inertia and System Strength Forecasting
- Inertia estimation and spatial strength metrics from high-resolution data  
- Continual learning and meta-learning for evolving topology  
- Robust algorithms for uncertainty in load, renewable generation, and dispatch  

This work integrates physics-informed modeling with modern learning techniques.

## 5. Electricity Markets, Congestion Geometry, and Economic Coordination

I study how physical network constraints shape economic outcomes in electricity markets and how market mechanisms interact with grid physics.

- Simulation and analysis of large-scale market operations  
- Formation of locational marginal prices as dual variables of network-constrained optimization  
- Modeling of congestion, redispatch, and economic efficiency  
- Intertemporal scheduling and operational limitations  
- Geometric interpretation of congestion based on network sensitivity structure  

This unifies physical flow modeling with economic decision processes.

## 6. Resilience, Reliability, and Extreme-Event Modeling

I investigate how networks respond to uncertainty, rare events, and structural disruptions.

- Quantification of resilience under uncertainty  
- Validation using high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulation  
- Graph-theoretic analysis of islanding, restoration, and survivability  
- Modeling of distributed energy resources and microgrid coordination  

This work integrates uncertainty modeling with the structure of physical networks.

## 7. Cyber-Physical Networks and Multi-Layer Interactions

Energy systems operate through tightly coupled physical, communication, and computational processes.  
I study how these layers interact and how risk propagates across them.

- Communication network modeling for grid applications  
- Mapping between communication demands and computational resources  
- Coupling among physical flows, communication delays, and control decisions  
- System-level risk arising from interconnected cyber-physical processes  

This work builds an integrated view of infrastructure that spans multiple layers of operation.

## 8. Broader Systems and Cross-Domain Network Insights

Beyond energy systems, I explore general principles that govern complex networks in many domains.

- Emergence of collective behavior from local interactions  
- Interplay among information flow, influence, and resource exchange  
- Stability, resilience, and adaptation in interconnected dynamical systems  

These insights support the analysis and design of complex engineered, social, and natural systems.
