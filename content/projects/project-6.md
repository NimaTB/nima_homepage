This project develops a **probabilistic resilience assessment framework** for distribution and microgrid systems under hurricane-induced disruptions.

## ▣ Problem

- Extreme weather events cause widespread outages  
- Need quantitative metrics for expected resilience and restoration feasibility  
- Load and PV generation uncertainty must be included  

## ▣ Approach

- Define a **time-dependent expected resilience metric**  
- Use **Point Estimate Method (PEM)** to propagate uncertainty  
- Compare results against Monte Carlo simulation  
- Apply **graph-theoretic restoration feasibility analysis**  

## ▣ Validation

- IEEE 37-node distribution system  
- Comparison of conventional vs. active distribution systems  
- Strong agreement with Monte Carlo, with far lower compute cost
