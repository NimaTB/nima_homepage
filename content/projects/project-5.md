A poster contribution demonstrating the use of **modal analysis** and **spectral PMU features** for disturbance detection and classification.

## ▣ Problem

Wide-area events leave modal signatures that are not captured by traditional SCADA indicators.

## ▣ Approach

- Extract modal dynamics from PMU windows  
- Build feature embeddings for event classification  
- Evaluate temporal stability of modal signatures  

## ▣ Publication
