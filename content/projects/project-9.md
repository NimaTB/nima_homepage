This project applies **NSGA-II multi-objective optimization** to size battery storage and determine wind penetration levels for optimal microgrid performance.

## ▣ Problem

Microgrid planning requires balancing cost, reliability, renewable penetration, and system constraints.

## ▣ Approach

- Formulate a multi-objective optimization problem  
- Use NSGA-II to explore tradeoffs in storage and wind integration  
- Analyze Pareto-front behavior across load and wind scenarios
