This project develops a general **resilience evaluation framework** for radial distribution feeders exposed to extreme events.

## ▣ Problem

Distribution networks experience structural vulnerabilities during storms and high-impact low-probability events.

## ▣ Approach

- Model resilience through topology, damage states, and restoration pathways  
- Use graph metrics to quantify accessibility and load-serving potential
