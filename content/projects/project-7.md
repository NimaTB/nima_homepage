This project applies **adaptive sliding-mode control** to virtual synchronous generators (VSGs) to improve microgrid frequency response and damping.

## ▣ Problem

- Converter-dominated microgrids lack physical inertia  
- VSGs emulate synchronous behavior but need robust control  
- Frequency excursions and oscillations persist under disturbances  

## ▣ Approach

- Design an **adaptive sliding-mode VSG controller**  
- Enhance frequency response and damping under varying conditions  
- Evaluate robustness against load changes and disturbances
